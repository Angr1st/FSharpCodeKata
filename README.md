# Coding Dojo

This Repo contains my attempt at solving all [Coding-Dojos](http://ccd-school.de/coding-dojo/)

Challenge nr. 1 was solved (Run this Command to show output: "dotnet .\FSharpConsole.dll "Name;Strasse;Ort;Alter" "Peter Pan;Am Hang 5;12345 Einsam;42" "Maria Schmitz;Kölner Straße 45;50123 Köln;43" "Paul Meier;Münchener Weg 1;87654 München;65"").

Challenge nr. 2 was solved just use dotnet FizzBuzz.dll after you have build the executable.
